# VTVL-Rocket-Booster-Reinforcement-Learning

This research presents a pioneering approach to
achieving safe vertical landing of Rocket Boosters using Rein-
forcement Learning (RL) with the Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO) algorithm. Focusing on Vertical Takeoff and Vertical
Landing (VTVL) rockets, specifically designed for barge landings,
our method addresses the challenge of landing amidst varying
wind speeds and altitudes. We propose a novel RL framework
that learns to dynamically adjust landing strategies in response
to changing environmental conditions. By rewarding successful
and proper vertical landings, our model optimizes for safety and
precision. Unlike traditional deterministic approaches, our RL-
based system demonstrates adaptability and robustness in real-
world scenarios, making it suitable for dynamic environments
like space exploration missions. Through extensive simulations
and validation, we showcase the efficacy and reliability of our
approach in achieving consistent and secure vertical landings
under diverse conditions. This research not only advances the
state-of-the-art in autonomous rocket landing systems but also
opens avenues for applying RL techniques to address complex
aerospace challenges.
